## Project Overview

The Task Manager Calendar App is a full-stack productivity tool that allows users to create, organize, and track tasks with due dates, priorities, and categories. It is designed to help users stay organized and focused, offering a clean user interface and dynamic task status tracking (Open → In Progress → Done).

Each user has their own private task list and can:

- Register or log in to their account
- Create new tasks with custom attributes (e.g., due date, priority)
- Edit or delete tasks
- Automatically mark tasks as "overdue" if the due date has passed
- Move tasks between status stages (Open, In Progress, Done)

The application uses Django REST Framework on the backend and React on the frontend. It is fully responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project was built as the Portfolio Project 5: Full-Stack Toolkit for the Code Institute diploma, demonstrating skills in Agile methodology, API development, user authentication, data handling, and deployment to a live platform.
