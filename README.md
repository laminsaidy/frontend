## Project Overview

The Task Manager Calendar App is a full-stack productivity tool that allows users to create, organize, and track tasks with due dates, priorities, and categories. It is designed to help users stay organized and focused, offering a clean user interface and dynamic task status tracking (Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done).

Each user has their own private task list and can:

- Register or log in to their account
- Create new tasks with custom attributes (e.g., due date, priority)
- Edit or delete tasks
- Automatically mark tasks as "overdue" if the due date has passed
- Move tasks between status stages (Open, In Progress, Done)

The application uses Django REST Framework on the backend and React on the frontend. It is fully responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project was built as the Portfolio Project 5: Full-Stack Toolkit for the Code Institute diploma, demonstrating skills in Agile methodology, API development, user authentication, data handling, and deployment to a live platform.

### User Stories & Epics

User stories were grouped into high-level Epics to guide feature development:

- üß© **Epic: User Authentication**
  - Register and login forms
  - Token handling and private route protection

- üß© **Epic: Task Management**
  - Create, update, delete tasks
  - Set due dates, priorities, categories
  - Status logic: Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done
  - Overdue detection

- üß© **Epic: UI & UX**
  - Responsive layout
  - Toast notifications
  - Tabbed filtering and color indicators

- üß© **Epic: Agile & Deployment**
  - Environment variable setup
  - README and testing documentation
  - Live deployment on Render

Each story included acceptance criteria and was linked to the appropriate Epic.

### Sprints

Development was split into two main sprints:

- **Sprint 1**
  - Set up backend with Django & DRF
  - Create models and authentication system
  - Build basic React structure and login flow

- **Sprint 2**
  - Implement task features (CRUD, filtering, overdue logic)
  - Style the app with status-based views
  - Add validation, toasts, and final deployment
